# Metadata-Issue-Tracking-Template
Template to help with metadata curation // issue tracking

To track issues, start by creating a new issue. There are templates in which you can choose from to start your issue ticket. You can modify the templates to suit your organization's needs. 
Once the issue is resolved, close the issue. Github will keep track of all issues (open and closed) with the functionality to re-open old issue tickets if the issue still persists. Issue tickets are a great way to keep of all issue tickets so that you can document who did what, where, how and why. This format also allows organizations to track common issues that can be resolved in future data curation developments (e.g., automation).

For information on how to create your own templates see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).
